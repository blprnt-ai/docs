<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Project">
    ### A Project is the workspace boundary for a codebase.

    - Add your project folder. This defines the sandbox the agent can safely read from and write to.
    - (Optional) Add an <strong>Agent Primer</strong> to set default context for every new session.
      - Use it for code conventions, naming patterns, architecture notes, workflows, product goals, and “gotchas”.
      - Treat it like the one page you wish every new teammate read before touching the repo.
    - blprnt will build context over time.
      - The agent can create memories to preserve key decisions, terminology, and structure.
      - Future sessions can reference these memories to stay consistent without you repeating yourself.
      - Memories can include user preferences too (e.g., “avoid red, use blue instead”).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a Session">
    ### Sessions are where you collaborate with the agent to get real work done.

    - Start a new Session inside your Project.
    - Describe what you want in a few sentences, including your constraints (scope, quality bar, and any “don’t touch” areas).
    - If you have context that shouldn’t be forgotten, add it to the prompt or to the Agent Primer so it applies to future sessions too.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Answer Clarifying Questions (If Needed)">
    ### If the request has multiple valid interpretations, blprnt will pause and ask you targeted multiple-choice questions.

    - This avoids wasted work and wrong assumptions.
    - Your answers become the basis for the plan and the acceptance criteria.
    - If something feels missing, this is the moment to add constraints (performance, UX expectations, compatibility, timelines).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Plan & Todos">
    ### Planning happens automatically: the agent will propose a plan with clear todos and acceptance criteria.

    - You’ll see a written plan that describes the approach and defines what “done” means.
    - You’ll see a list of todos with statuses so progress is visible as work happens.
    - Review for scope and sequencing:
      - If it’s too big, ask to split it into smaller todos.
      - If it’s too risky, ask for safer steps (or a research-first todo).
      - If it’s missing something, ask to add acceptance criteria before execution starts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch Execution & Verification">
    ### Once you approve, the agent will move through the todos and keep the plan updated as it goes.

    - The primary agent may spawn specialized subagents to handle parts of the work (research, design, execution, verification).
    - Todos move through statuses as each unit of work is completed and checked.
    - If verification finds an issue, the agent will loop back to fix it before continuing-so you don’t accumulate broken work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Suggested First Task (Safe + Useful)

If you’re not sure what to try first:

> Read through the codebase and understand the overall architecture and flow. Then suggest a small UI improvement with a plan to implement it.

Or if it's a brand new project, you can start with a brainstorming session to get a sense of the project and then create a plan to implement it.

It’s the fastest way to learn the blprnt loop: plan → execute → verify.

<Tip>
  If you're not sure what to do, just ask the agent to help you.
