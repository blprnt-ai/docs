blprnt.ai is a text-to-product platform that turns natural language into working software. Use the features below to plan, build, and ship with confidence.

## Orchestration runtime

### Execution model

- Tool routing enforces which operations are permitted in each state.
- Pause, resume, or cancel queued work without losing state.
- Tasks run as a state machine with explicit transitions for `plan`, `run`, `verify`, and `finalize`.

### Reliability controls

- Execution metadata records decisions, tool calls, and outcomes for auditing.
- Timeout handling and step-level error capture provide predictable failure surfaces.

## Natural language to code

Generate code from natural language with tool calling and project-aware context.

## Agent system

- Agent specializations: Planner, Executor, Verifier, Researcher, and Designer roles.
- Multi-agent system with subagents that run in isolated sessions.
- Reasoning effort control that adapts reasoning depth per turn.

## Prompting and context

- Prompt templating assembles system prompts using personality, skills, primer, and directories.
- Skills system to register, apply, and reference skills in sessions.
- Project primer to inject project-level instructions into each session.

## Project and session management

- Create, list, rename, and delete sessions and projects.
- History and rewind to review and restore previous states.
- In-session planning with `todo` tracking and persistent `plan` tools.
- Memory store with vector-searchable project and user scopes.

## Performance, safety, and security

- An essentially infinite context window allows for complex and long-running tasks.
- Secure vault with stronghold-based key and license storage.
- Sandbox security with capability-based filesystem access.

## Model providers

Choose from multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, and many more.
